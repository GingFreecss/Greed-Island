A group of NPCs that reside in a mountain. When any player comes near their village, they will appear and beg for help, claiming to be suffering from an endemic disease. The player can decide whether to give anything to help the villagers or not. There is the option of giving away all their money and equipment. Doing so, the player expects to receive a rare card in return, however, nothing happens, except a mere "thank you" from the bandits.
If the player is in possession of the Paladin's Necklace, it is possible to cure the villagers of their disease. The villagers then give them the rare card #75 Wild Luck Alexandrite as a reward.
