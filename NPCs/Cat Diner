The Cat Diner NPCs are a group of NPCs that runs a restaurant in Antokiba. They can provide information about the monthly tournaments, basic information about cards, and how to get money in the island.
Their restaurant offers players to eat an incredibly large serving of pasta with no charge and a Gargider card if they can finish it within thirty minutes. Soda can help the player win the challenge. The soda is offered by the Cat Diner, without any mention of price, so the player is made to believe it is free. Discovering only later that, if he cannot pay for it, washing dishes is required.
