Rules of the game as stated in chapter 127.

WELCOME TO GREED ISLAND

The goal of the game is to complete the book.

Rules of the game:
1) In this game, whoever has the ring can use two spells "Book" and "Gain".


---
BOOK

Imposed slots: 100 (numbered 000 - 099)
Each slot has a number. Each slot only accepts the card with the right number.



Free slots: 45
Any cards can be slotted into free slots.
---



2)All the items you find in the game can be converted into cards. Book is used to store the cards.


---
When you acquire an item, it immediately turns into a card. (Eg: Finding and taking a sword will automatically turn it into a card)
Cards slotted into the book can no longer be used unless the player uses "gain". However, a card transformed via "gain" can no longer be converted back into a card.
  - If you want to transform the sword into a card again, you must acquire the same sword again.



Limited number of card transformations:

(1) All the items in the island have a limited number of transformations. Although there's more than 100 copies of each total, each card only has a limit of 3 that can be in card-state at a time.
  - For example: Imagine there's an item, 3 copies of which are in the form of a card. If each player with the card stores it in the book, the limit of transformations is reached. Consequently, even if another player finds the same item and takes it, it won't turn into a card.

(2) All cards must be stored in the book, othewise the card will automatically turn back into an item within 1 minute. In that case, retransformation is no longer possible.
---




3)You must collect the numbered slots in order to complete the game.


4) If you were to die during the game, the book and the ring will be destroyed.


Have fun!
