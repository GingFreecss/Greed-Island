There is a limit on how many items can be transformed into cards, once that limit is reached other players that acquire the same item will not get the item into its card form. The higher the card rank is, the lower its Card Transformations Limit would be.

Spell cards can only be acquired in shops in the town of Masadora; they can be purchased in packs containing random spell cards. In order to use a spell card you have to hold it in your hand, say its name followed up with the keyword "On" then the name of the player or place you want it to be designated. Another method is to insert the spell card into the slot at the end of the binder. Spell cards disappear after using it. There are a total of 41 different spell cards.
