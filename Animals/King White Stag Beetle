A rare white beetle in Greed Island, uses special pheromones to lure other insects to build a huge colony. It leaves the colony once a day for an evening stroll.

To catch it, the player must have enough strength to cause enough movement to a huge tree. A hammer is offered by the guard. However, the player can opt to not use it, but rather bare hands. (choice depends on the player's raw strength versus weapon skills). The harder the hit, the more beetles will fall from the tree.

This card's designated number is 53, therefore it is needed in order to finish the game. It is an A-rank card with a 30-card limit.
