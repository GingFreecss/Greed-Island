The Bubble Horse is a type of horse that releases red and white bubbles that when popped, releases a loud noise which it uses the oppurtunity to escape.

The Bubble Horse releases white and red bubbles from its mouth, and shakes them off with his tail. The bubbles spread around and act as a diversion. White bubbles will burst if they come in contact with aura. On the other hand, red bubbles will burst if they touch anything other than aura, if it's a person in a Zetsu state, or any other object.

A C-rank card with a 50-card limit. Its designated number is 585. It can be obtained once the horse is caught.
